Welcome to my Server Settings:

cfggameplay.json.

this is my customized stamina setting for my DayZ Server:

■ Server:  Native Land |  PVP  | Survival | Vanilla| by chilliyTV
■ 50 Slots
■ IP: 5.9.77.42:2947
■ Map: ANASTARA


i played a lot with the parameters and i found this setting fits the best for me.
it has not complete unlimited stamina - it is a good mix from the vanilla settings with a bit extra limits.
